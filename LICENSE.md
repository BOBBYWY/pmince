# Portable MINCE

**Portable MINCE**<sup>†</sup> ("the Software") exists solely for the socially
beneficial purposes of scholarship, historic preservation, research, and
education.

The Software is distributed **without cost**, **AS IS**, and without warranty of
any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the warranties of
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

The **Portable MINCE** authors make no warranty or representation regarding the
accuracy, currency, completeness, authenticity, reliability, or usefulness of
the Software.

All product names, brand names, logos, service marks, trademarks, and registered
trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

All company, product, and service names used in the Software are for
identification purposes only. Use of these names, brands, and marks does not
imply endorsement.

The **Portable MINCE** authors could find no evidence of the trademark being
actively used in commerce by **Mark of the Unicorn, Inc.** after March 1986, or
by any distributor, licensee, or reseller after December 1994.

Thus, it is our belief that the use of the term "**MINCE**" by **Portable
MINCE** is legally permissible and does not constitute trademark infringement.

Furthermore, the **Portable MINCE** authors make no claims to the term
"**MINCE**".

- <sup>†</sup>The [MINCE trademark](legal/73576514.pdf), _USSN **73576514**_,
  _USRN **1404754**_, was **cancelled** by the USPTO on May 19th 2007, due to
  the failure of the registrant to timely file an acceptable Section 8
  declaration.

from **BDS C**, by _Leor Zolman_ of _BD Software_.

**BDS C** is **public domain software**.

```text
I, Leor Zolman, hereby release all rights to BDS C (all
binary and source code modules, including compiler, linker,
library sources, utilities, and all documentation) into the
Public Domain. Anyone is free to download, use, copy, modify,
sell, fold, spindle or mutilate any part of this package

## L2 (New) Linker

**Portable MINCE** includes the **L2 (New) Linker** for **BDS C**, by _Scott_
_W._ _Layson_.

The **L2 (New) Linker** is **public domain software**.

```text
L2 New Linker for BDS C

This is an improved linker for BDS C CRL format.

It eliminates the jump table at the beginning of each
function in the object code, thus saving up to 10% or
so in code space with a slight improvement in speed.

Written 1980 by Scott W. Layson

This code is in the public domain.

## AUG (Amethyst Users Group) data

The **Portable MINCE** distribution contains files collected and distributed by
"**AUG**", the _**Amethyst Users Group**_.

When the **AUG** was an active organization, membership was restricted to
**Amethyst**, **MINCE**, and **Scribble** license holders, per an agreement
between _**Mark of the Unicorn, Inc.**_ and the _**Amethyst Users Group**_.

However, **AUG** is now defunct (since at least 1994), and the **AUG** archives
have been publicly available and openly distributed (since at least 1988) by
many organizations, including the _Massachusetts Institute of Technology_
_**CPMUG**_ _Repository_, _**SIMTEL**_‑_20_, _**SIG/M**_, _**PC/Blue**_,
_**Walnut Creek**_ _CD‑ROM_, _Software Tools of Australia_, _Oakland University_
via the _**Oak Repository**_, _Demon Internet_, and many others.

The **AUG** archives included in the **Portable MINCE** distribution contains
**only** data that was known to be previously publicly available and openly
distributed.

## Other Code

Any other code not covered above is released under the ISC license.
