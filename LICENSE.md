# Portable MINCE

**Portable MINCE**<sup>†</sup> ("the Software") exists solely for the socially beneficial purposes of scholarship, historic preservation, research, and education.

The Software is distributed **without cost**, **AS IS**, and without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including, but not limited to, the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

The **Portable MINCE** authors make no warranty or representation regarding the accuracy, currency, completeness, authenticity, reliability, or usefulness of the Software.

All product names, brand names, logos, service marks, trademarks, and registered trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

All company, product, and service names used in the Software are for identification purposes only. Use of these names, brands, and marks does not imply endorsement.

The **Portable MINCE** authors could find no evidence of the trademark being actively used in commerce by **Mark of the Unicorn, Inc.** after March 1986, or by any distributor, licensee, or reseller after December 1994.

Thus, it is our belief that the use of the term "**MINCE**" by **Portable MINCE** is legally permissible and does not constitute trademark infringement. Furthermore, the **Portable MINCE** authors make no claims to the term "**MINCE**".

* <sup>†</sup>The **MINCE** trademark, _USSN **73576514**_, _USRN **1404754**_, was **cancelled** by the USPTO on May 19th 2007, due to the failure of the registrant to timely file an acceptable Section 8 declaration.

## L2 (New) Linker

**Portable MINCE** includes the **L2 (New) Linker** for **BDS C**, by *Scott* *W.* *Layson*.

The **L2 (New) Linker** is **public domain software**.

```text
L2 New Linker for BDS C

This is an improved linker for BDS C CRL format.  

It eliminates the jump table at the beginning of each
function in the object code, thus saving up to 10% or
so in code space with a slight improvement in speed.  

Written 1980 by Scott W. Layson

This code is in the public domain.

## AUG (Amethyst Users Group) data

The **Portable MINCE** distribution contains files collected and distributed by "**AUG**", the _**Amethyst Users Group**_. 

When the **AUG** was an active organization, membership was restricted to **Amethyst**, **MINCE**, and **Scribble** license holders, per an agreement between _**Mark of the Unicorn, Inc.**_ and the _**Amethyst Users Group**_.

However, **AUG** is now defunct (since at least 1994), and the **AUG** archives have been publicly available and openly distributed (since at least 1985) by many organizations, including the *Massachusetts Institute of Technology* _**CPMUG**_ *Repository* via *MIT-MC*, _**SIMTEL**_-*20*, _**SIG/M**_, _**PC/Blue**_, _**Walnut Creek**_ *CD-ROM*, *Software Tools of Australia*, *Oakland University* via the _**Oak Repository**_, *Demon Internet*, and many others.

The **AUG** archives included in the **Portable MINCE** distribution contains **only** data that was known to be previously publicly available and openly distributed.
