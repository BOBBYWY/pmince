Perfect Writer has the advanced features you would expect to find
in expensive word processors, such as:

@BEGIN(ENUMERATE)
The full range of @VALUE(SUM) formatting options that allow you to
automatically format letters, outlines, form letters, memorandum,
articles, books or other types of documents.

Full cursor controls that allow you to move quickly and easily
anywhere in the document in order to:
@ITEMIZE(insert

delete

search, search and replace, and search and replace with query)
@END(ENUMERATE)
What makes @VALUE(SUM) unique, however, are the features you
won't find in other word processors costing many times its price,
such as: 

@BEGIN(DESCRIPTION)
virtual memory@\Allows you to edit a full length novel as easily
as you would edit a letter.

dual display@\Allows you to divide the screen into two parts,
each showing a different document.
@END(DESCRIPTION)
We hope this very brief description encourages you to take a
closer look at all the numerous features of @VALUE(SUM).
