Mark Twain gave probably the best advice on writing and editing
when he said "When it doubt, strike it out!"

Of course, Mark Twain did not have Perfect Writer then to help
him delete things.  He certainly would be amazed at how quickly
and neatly deletions from a text can be made now.  No more having to
work around lines that have been 'eX'd  out'.  No more having to
write back IN something you have mistakenly scratched over.  (Perfect
Writer temporarily saves all deletions larger than a single
character.) 

As to the deletions commands,note that the Escape and Control
commands share for the most part the same relationship here as
they did for moving the cursor. That is, while a Control----D will
delete the next character, Escape.....D will delete the
next word.

Again, you don't have to learn all the commands at once.  A few
to start will serve you well for a long time.
