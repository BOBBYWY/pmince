This is sentence ONE; it goes after the paragraph.

This is sentence TWO; it will get switched.

This is sentence THREE; it will stay put.

This is sentence FOUR; where does it go?

This is the last paragraph, which is going to be placed at the
beginning of the text.  That will be a trick.  Actually, it is
simple:  Mark the boundaries, 'Wipe' the region, move the cursor,
and 'Yank' it back!
