@MajorHeading(EDITME1: Learning the Commands)

Probably the best way to learn the Cursor Commands is by
remembering that the command character represents in most cases
the action that the command is supposed to produce: i.e. "F" for
forward, "B" for backward, etc. This is called a 'mnemnonic'
relationship.

Notice also that the CONTROL key commands and ESCAPE key commands
are related, in that in many cases the ESCAPE Commands simply
produce the same action only on a larger scale.  For example,
"CONTROL ----- F" moves the cursor forward one character, while
"ESCAPE ----- F" moves the cursor forward one 'word'.  This
relationship holds true for a great many of Perfect Writer's
commands, not just those that move the cursor.  It is a design
feature of Perfect Writer that will help you learn the commands
quickly.


As you have probably guessed, you don't have to learn all of the
commands right away to begin using Perfect Writer.  Learn them as
you need them. This takes the pressure out of learning about
Perfect Writer. For example, you really only need to
know FOUR commands to move the cursor anywhere you want (though
it will be slow). Which ones are they?


It could happen that you will never learn by heart all the
commands Perfect Writer offers.  But this is alright, because you
really don't need to.  Some of them you will probably use only
rarely, but they are there if you need them.

Have you removed the Command Summary card from your User Manual
yet? This card is handy to keep near your keyboard.  It provides
a very quick reference to all of Perfect Writer's commands.
