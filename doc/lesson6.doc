      During Lesson 6, you should be reading from your terminal
again, rather than from this manual.  Type to the operating
system:

      mince lesson6.doc

and wait for Mince to get started.  By putting a file name on the
command line, you cause the file to be automatically read in when
Mince starts up.  As with Lesson 4, if Mince says "New File", and
this text does not appear, something is wrong.  Determine the
cause and use the C-X C-R command to read in the file, if you
need to.

      In this lesson, we are going to learn how to delete whole
bunches of text, rather than characters or words at a time.  The
command to delete lines is C-K.  (Control K stands for "Kill
line".)  Move the cursor to the first line of this paragraph with
C-P or C-N.  Now type a C-K.  Whatever was on that line has
disappeared.  Now type another C-K.  The line itself has
disappeared and all the other lines of text have been moved up.

      Now move the cursor to the first line of this paragraph,
and move halfway into the line with C-F's or M-F's.  Again, type
a C-K.  You will notice that only the part of the line to the
right of the cursor was killed.  C-K kills text starting with the
character which the cursor is resting on until it reaches a
newline, or the newline itself, if the line is blank.

      You see that in order to physically remove an entire line
AND its contents, you must type two C-K's.  Similarly, C-U C-K
removes two entire lines and their contents, rather than four.
You will find this command useful for retyping previously
existing lines of text, where you want to remove what the line
(or the "rest" of the line, starting at the cursor) says, but
want to fill it with something else.

      Typing many C-K's in a row could get to be a drag,
especially if you intend to delete an entire paragraph or
chapter.  You could count the lines to be deleted and type C-U,
twice the number, C-K; this would still be pretty time-consuming.
(Counting lines is even more annoying than typing C-K many
times!)  Instead, Mince has a command to kill an entire region of
text.  It is called C-W (for "Wipe region").

      You must define the region of text to be killed first.  One
end of the region which C-W will wipe out is shown by where the
cursor is in the text.  The other end of the region is given by a
"mark", which we will now learn how to set.  The command which
sets the invisible mark is C-@ (for "set the mark AT this
position").  Move the cursor to the beginning of some line in the
middle of this paragraph.  Type C-@.  (Note that on some
terminals you may have to hold down the Shift key and the Control
key to get a C-@.)  Down in the echo line you should see the
message "Mark Set."  If it does not appear, you may have a poor
terminal whose C-@ doesn't send the command.  Try typing C-@
again, and if it doesn't work this time, type a Control SPACE
now, and use it from now on if it works, rather than the Control
at-sign.

      Having figured that out, move to the end of the same line
and type a C-W.  Look at the text; the portion of it between the
cursor (at the end of the line) and the invisible mark (at the
beginning of the line) should have disappeared.

      Let's wipe something slightly bigger than a line.  Move the
cursor to the beginning of this paragraph, and set the mark there
by typing C-@.  Now move the cursor to the end of this paragraph
and type a C-W.  You shouldn't be able to read this sentence any
more!

      What if we make a mistake and wipe out a huge block of text
unintentionally?  There is a command to retrieve the text which
was just killed, C-Y (for "Yank back killed text").  Do that now:
type a C-Y and the paragraph we just deleted should appear back
where the cursor is now.

      Now move the cursor down a few lines and type C-Y again.
Another copy of that text appears at the cursor.  Type the C-Y
again; the text should be replicated one more time.  You've just
learned how to copy or move text, all with one command, C-Y!  To
make a copy of some text, wipe it out (using C-@ and C-W) and
immediately yank it back with a C-Y in that spot (i.e., without
moving the cursor).  Then, move the cursor to the spot where you
would like the copy to appear, and type another C-Y.  If you want
to move a block of text rather than copy it, just don't type the
C-Y at the original position.  (If deleting text and then yanking
it back in the same place in order to do a copy of some text
makes you nervous, you might want to look at the description of
the M-W command in the Mince User's Manual.  It works similarly
to C-W, but it does the first C-Y automatically for you.)

      C-W is not the only command which saves text in case you
want to yank it back.  C-K, M-D, and M-<DEL> all save text as
well.  In general, if you delete anything larger than a
character, Mince will save it for you in case you want to move or
copy it (or undo a mistake!).

      As an example, move the cursor to the beginning of this
paragraph, and type a couple of C-K's.  Notice that a "plus" sign
has come on at the right edge of the mode line.  This means that
if you continue to type C-K's, the text killed will be added on
to whatever killed text is already being stored.  So, you can
kill a region of text, with either a C-@/C-W or with a bunch of
C-K's (or even M-D's or some combination of all of these), and a
C-Y will still yank the entire region back.

      Mince will only store your "most recent" bunch of text
kills, however.  What determines what is "recent" and what is
not?  The plus-sign at the right of the mode line.  If you are
about to delete something larger than a character and the plus is
not there, you will be throwing away whatever previous bunch of
kills you did.  In general, all this amounts to is that, if you
give any movement commands or insert anything after killing some
text, you will "close off" the current group of kills.  (You will
also see the plus-sign go away.)  Any C-Y's you type after this
will retrieve that group.  Any C-K's, M-D's, M-<DEL>'s, or C-W's
you do after this will throw away that group of kills and start a
brand new one.

      There is a command to "turn on the plus sign".  This is
used if you want to move groups of lines from several different
places all to one place.  Certainly you could do this manually,
doing a few C-K's, moving to the right place, doing a C-Y, going
somewhere else and doing some C-K's or a C-W, moving back to the
right place, doing another C-Y, etc.  It would be much easier to
do C-K's or C-W's in all the various places and then yank the
whole thing back with a single C-Y.  But we said earlier that
movement away from the place of the text killing or wiping causes
the plus-sign to go off and the current bunch of kills to be
"closed off".  The command to turn the plus sign back on is
M-C-W.  (This is your first "M-C-" command.  Remember that you
just type ESC Control W.)  You can remember this command by its
intimate relation with C-W (and M-W, if you use it).

      As M-C-W is sort of hard to think about, there is no
substitute for practice.  Move to the beginning of this paragraph
and kill the text on the first line, in whatever manner is
convenient.  Then move to the last line.  Notice that the plus in
the mode line has gone off.  Type a M-C-W to turn it on, then
kill off the text on the last line.  Now move into the middle of
what's left and type a C-Y.  You will see both the first and last
lines appear there at once.

      Play around with all these commands a little bit.  Try
deleting the last five words of this sentence and yanking them
back at the beginning of the sentence.  Then, move this paragraph
so that it is the first paragraph in the lesson.  Try doing C-W's
with the cursor both before and after the invisible mark you set,
and observe the results.  Killing and yanking text is one of the
most complicated, confusing, and hard-to-explain features of
Mince.  Take your time and experiment enough to make sure that
you understand these commands.

      When you're all done type a C-X C-C and answer "Y" for
"yes" when Mince asks you if you want to abandon the text buffer
without saving it.  You wouldn't want to destroy the file
"lesson6.doc" for the next person, after all.  We'll learn more
about text buffers and neat tricks you can do with C-Y and lots
of different buffers in Lesson 8.
