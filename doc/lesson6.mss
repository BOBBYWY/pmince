There are three basic reasons
for maintaining computer room security.  
These are:
@enumerate[Preventing access to the computer itself.

Preventing access to the data physically contained in the computer.

Preventing access to the communication lines leading out of the
computer.]
@Paragraph(Computer access)
There are simple reasons to keep people away from the computer itself:
a vandal can
physically destroy the equipment or disrupt the service it
provides.  Either can be costly, but both are easily discovered
(after the fact!).
@Paragraph(Physical data access)
Where there is a computer, there are usually disk and tape drives
and the storage media they use in close proximity.  Theft of
online media is easy to detect (@I(most)
computer systems complain if you remove a disk or tape from the
drive while it is in use!), but if the data contained therein is
itself secret or valuable, detection is not as important as
prevention.  Theft of off-line media (e.g. backup tapes) is
almost as easy to detect, but less likely to be noticed immediately.
