      For this lesson, you will be reading from your terminal
rather than from this paper.  Get into Mince as usual, and type:

      Control X Control R  lesson4.doc

followed by a carriage-return.  You should see this text appear
on your screen.  If it does not, and Mince says "New File" in the
echo line at the bottom of the screen, first make sure that you
had typed the name correctly.  If not, just try again; if so,
stop and get help finding the file.

      We will be playing around with some new commands on this
text.  In order to keep reading from your terminal, you will have
to type Control V's (View next page) every time you reach the
bottom of the scren.  Do that now.  Type a "Control V" and forget
about the paper copy of this lesson.

      The first command we will learn this time is the "search"
command, "Control S".  Suppose someone has given you a draft for
corrections, and somewhere in the middle has marked a phrase to
be changed.  It's easy enough to see it on paper, because the
place is marked in red ink or the like.  But it requires extra
work to find it on the computer.  It's almost as though you had
been handed the same report, unmarked, and been told that some
phrase should be deleted!

      Certainly we could scan through the file looking for the
marked place using Control V's, but it might take a while.
Instead, we can use the computer to search through the file,
looking for the proper place.

      Try that now.  Type:

      Control S

(You might want to look back at the paper copy of this lesson for
just a little while now, since Control V's won't work while we're
in the middle of a search.)  Mince will respond to the Control S
by printing "Forward Search <ESC>:" in the echo line at the
bottom of the screen.  Now type in the word:

      search

You will see it echoed at the bottom of the screen.  If you make
a mistake while typing this, you can use the DELETE key, just as
you would normally.  After you've entered the string to search
for, type the ESCAPE key.  This tells Mince to begin searching.

      A forward search begins at the character the cursor is on,
continues until the searched-for item is found, and when it is,
positions the cursor just after it.  So, when you hit the ESCAPE
key, you should have seen the cursor jump to one of the
occurrences of the word "search" in this lesson.  It should still
be there now, unless you've had to type Control V's to read more.
If so, try it again.  Type:

      Control S   search  ESCAPE

      Now just try typing:

      Control S  ESCAPE

That is, do not type in any character string to be search for;
just hit the ESCAPE key right after the Control S.  You should
notice the cursor jump to the next occurrence of the word
"search".  When you do not give the Control S command a new
character string to look for, it searches for whatever you told
it last time.  This can be quite a timesaver, especially when
working with technical papers, where long, hard-to-type phrases
are commonly used several times, and you want to find, say, the
sixth occurrence.

      What happens if there is no character string exactly like
the one you type for Control S?  Try it and see.  Do a search for
a nonsense word.  If there is no such word between the cursor and
the end of the text, as you see, Mince will cause the terminal to
beep and will print the phrase "Not Found" at the right of the
echo line.

      As you may have guessed by the message that Mince printed
in the echo line earlier, "Forward Search", there is a "backward"
search as well.  It is used to search backwards in the text from
the current cursor position.  The command is called "Reverse
search", and is performed by Control R.  All of the features of
Control R are identical to Control S, except that, since it
searches through the text in reverse, it leaves the cursor before
the closest item that matches the string, rather than after it.
Notice that the character string to be searched for is saved and
is the same one for both Control R and Control S.  So, you may
find yourself typing "Control S", a string, and the ESCAPE, and
then, if you hear a beep, typing "Control R ESCAPE" because you
know the string is in the text somewhere.

      Play around with these a little bit, then type Control X
Control C to leave the editor.  The next lesson, Lesson 5, should
be read off the printed page, but for Lesson 6 we'll be working
exclusively on the terminal again.
