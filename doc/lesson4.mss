It has come to my attention that:
@Begin(Enumerate)
The @Value(SUM) is quite a way from being completed.
You must lash the drelbs who are writing that rag more often -- it
improves their work.

Product orders are slipping.
You must lash the customers more often -- it improves sales.

My mind is slipping.
Not much we can do about that really.  I have tried a few remedies,
though:
@Itemize(Chess -- this only makes matters worse.

Transcendental meditation -- this makes matters change, but doesn't
improve my mind any.

Lashing -- This seems most effective, but isn't much fun.)
@End(Enumerate)
But pardon me...  (my mind is slipping, don't you know)   We were
talking about the @Value(SUM).  Allow me to describe some of the
delightful ways the drelbs can amuse themselves while writing this
drab stuff.
@Begin(Description)
Head-twisting@\Whether done singly or in pairs, head-twisting can
produce remarkable brainwave effects.  When done in pairs (i.e.
taking both of a drelb's heads and twisting them together), a
certain ethereal and schizophrenic quality in the writing is the
result.

Limb-biting@\This has no particular mental effect on the drelbs, but
they like doing it to each other, so the overall group effect is quite
worthwhile.  They get a lot more writing done afterward, but the
handwriting is very jerky!
@End(Description)
I hope that this has been helpful to you, and that the @Value(SUM)
will be in my beak very soon.
