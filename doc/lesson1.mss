If time be of all things
the most precious, wasting time must be, as Poor Richard says,
the greatest prodigality; since,
as
he elsewhere tells us, lost time
    is never found again; and what
we call time enough, always proves little enough:
Let us then up and be doing, and doing to the purpose;
so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity.

          If time be of all things the most precious wasting
time must be fun but without punctuation words run together and
we eventually lose track of what we are talking about which
is just as well because Poor Richard was such a dingaling
that he used to fly kites in the rain.
