                      Directory of Old Data Base
     In order to copy data from another data base, you must specify
the "directory" in which that data base resides.  (In the case of CP/M
based systems, the directory is merely the single letter designation
of a disk drive -- e.g. A, B, etc).

     The "dbfetch" program should be used (1) when a field has been 
added or deleted from the data base with the "gendb" program or (2) 
when you wish to copy data from any other data base (including pre-
packaged data bases available from Urban Software).  The program 
works by comparing the tag of each field of the current data base with
each the tags of the one being copied, and copying data between the
fields that match.










	          Subsystem to Copy from Old Data Base
     You must specify here exactly what you want to copy from the old data
base.  Note that any data copied from the old data base is ADDED to existing
data.  If you want to delete the data in your current data base before copying
in new data, then use the "Reinitialization" option in the "gendb" program.

                       Subset of Members to Copy
     You have chosen to copy records from one data base to another.  You
have the option of copying any subset of records that has been defined in
the database into which the records will be copied.  If you want to copy
the whole data base, then select the "All Members" option.  If you want to
copy a subset which is defined in the source data base but not in the target
data base, then Escape from this level and copy the subset definitions
from the source data base to the target data base.
          
     The record copy utility first compares each tag of the source data base
with the tags of the target data base.  For each field whose tags match,
data will be copied from the field of the source record to the corresponding 
field of the target record.
