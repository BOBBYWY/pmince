			Current Data Base Disk Drive
     You must enter here the single letter identifier [e.g. A,B,C etc.]
of the disk drive in which the data base currently resides.  Type in
the letter followed by return.  It does not matter whether you use
an upper case or lower case letter.

     Note that you can execute the LEVERAGE program with the data base
disk drive as an argument--e.g. "leverage a" to access a data base on
disk A.

     Note also that the LEVERAGE program must be executed from the
disk on which it resides.  You may NOT, for example, run a LEVERAGE   
program on the "A" disk from the "B" disk by typing "a:leverage".
