                        List Format Selection
     To generate a list, you must specify three things: the list format,
the subset to be listed, and the list targets.  Here you must select the
list format from the menu of formats that have been defined.  To define a
new list format or to revise an existing format, ESCape from this program
and select the "Define List Format" option
     There are four components to the list format: (1) the list heading
format; (2) the page format [which includes the page size and the 
bottom margin];  3) the list member format and (4) the sort keys 
[which include the subheadings].  The format components are described 
fully in the list format definition module.    












			List Subset Selection
     Here you must select the subset you wish to list.  You have a choice 
of listing all of the members in the data base or any subset of them that 
you have defined.  To define a subset, ESCape from this program and select 
the "Define Subsets" option.
     In generating a list, the system checks each data base member to see
if it is in the specified subset and extracts the sort keys of the members
in that subset.  It then sorts these keys.  After the keys are sorted, the 
list will be directed to the specified targets.














			List Target Selection
     You may select any combination of the following dispositions for the 
list to be generated.  Hit ESCape when you have finished selecting targets.

1.   CRT.  List will be printed on this CRT as it is generated.

2.   Printer.  List will be printed on the hardcopy unit as it is generated.

3.   File.  List will be stored in a disk file for subsequent review and
     printout.  You will be asked to specify the file name.

4.   Sort Image.  The sort order of the list will be saved in a disk
     file.  If this option is selected, then the sort order will be
     available to other programs (such as the mail generating program).

     CRT output only is initially enabled as a list target.  The targets
can be enabled and disabled in a toggle-switch fashion by selecting the
appropriate menu option.  Whether a target is currently activated is 
indicated after the menu option.

=> Hit ESCape when you are finished selecting list targets <=


			List Target Disk File Name
     If you wish to store the list output on the disk, you must give the
disk file a name so that it can be accessed later.  Type in the name
and then hit return, or hit Escape to abort disk file targetting.



















			Sort Image Disk File Name
     If you wish to save the sort order, then you must supply a name for 
the disk file in which the sort image will be stored.  Type the name followed
by Return, or hit ESCape to abort sort image targetting.
