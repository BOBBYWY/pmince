			Date Specification
     You have chosen to set the current date, and you should type in the
month, day and year here.  Use numbers for each component of the date,
and hit Return after you have entered each component.  If today is 
July 4, 1981, for instance, you should enter 7 for the month, 4 for
the day and 81 for the year.

    If you do not want to specify the date, hit ESCape to escape.















			Current Data Base Disk Drive
     You must enter here the single letter identifier [e.g. A,B,C etc.]
of the disk drive in which the data base currently resides.  Type in
the letter followed by return.  It does not matter whether you use
an upper case or lower case letter.

     Note that you can execute the LEVERAGE program with the data base
disk drive as an argument--e.g. "leverage a" to access a data base on
disk A.

     Note also that the LEVERAGE program must be executed from the
disk on which it resides.  You may NOT, for example, run a LEVERAGE   
program on the "A" disk from the "B" disk by typing "a:leverage".
