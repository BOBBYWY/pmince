                                       by
                                   Herb Schulz
                                     8/1/82

            The following changes are made to MINCE:

            1.  Separate 'C' mode and 'SAVE' mode activation equates. 
                This allows 'C' mode activation without 'SAVE' mode. 

            2.  Activated 'C' mode to get auto-indent after '{', etc. 
                The  original version (embedded in the  code  but  not
                activated in MINCE.COM) left the '}' line indented and
                only  "un-indented" the following lines.  I hate  that
                style so I also

            3.  changed 'C' mode  to "un-indent" the line with the '}'
                as well as the following lines.  This gives rise to  a
                style that looks like

                                  if (foobar) {
                                          dothis();
                                          andthis();
                                  }

                rather than

                                  if (foobar) {
                                          dothis();
                                          andthis();
                                          } .

            4.  Added  M_(  and  M_{  commands which produce () and {}
                pairs respectively,  placing  the  point  between  the
                characters.   This  will  ensure  that  one always has
                matching parenthesis and curly braces.  When you  want
                to enter the ')' or '}' you need only C-F over it. 

            5.  Added a C-Z  command  that  duplicates  M_V  (previous
                page).  This gives a duplicate for the present  screen
                of C-X_Z for the "other" screen.   It  also makes it a
                bit  easier  to  go back and forth to Perfect  Writer,
                which doesn't implement M_V at  all  (that can also be
                added there). 

            6.  Page mode is  thoroughly  destroyed.   The  only thing
                left  is  the   ability   to  overwrite  (rather  than
                insert).  I've even changed the name of  the  mode  to
                "Over" rather than "Page".


          The changes require the files:

          BINDINGS.DIF   - dif file for BINDINGS.C (change 1, 4, 5 & 6
                         above)

          COMM1.DIF      - dif file for COMM1.C  (changes 1, 2, 3, 4 &
                         6 above)

          COMM3.DIF      - dif file for COMM3.C (change 6 only)

          SUPPORT.DIF    - dif file for SUPPORT.C (change 1 & 6 above)

          MC-GBL.DIF     - dif  file  for  MINCE.GBL (separate #define
                         for CMODE added)

            After running SSED  on  the  appropriate  files it is only
          necessary to  recompile  and link the files as prescribed in
          the  MC.SUB  file supplied with MINCE (with the  appropriate
          file name changes for the new changed file of course). 

            NOTES:

            1.  The only compiling change from the MC.SUB file was the
                necessity to make more room for the symbol  table when
                compiling  the new version of  support.c  (-r10  fixed
                that). 

            2.  I used Version 1.46 of BDS C to  compile the code.   I
                know  version 1.44 also works but  you  shouldn't  use
                anything before 1.44.

            3.  There are two warnings when linking:

                  1.  Make sure that the code doesn't go past the 7900
                      base  for  the  externals.   I'm working with  a
                      slighly  hacked  up version of C.CCC  which  has
                      eliminated all  the  initialization,  etc.   for
                      memory mapped video.   Using  this C.CCC my code
                      ends at 7811. A friend using an Apple  (the code
                      for initializing  port  i/o as well as inp() and
                      outp() have  also  been  hacked by him) has even
                      more room.  If you are going to use the standard
                      C.CCC  look   carefully   at  the  end  of  code
                      information given to you by L2.

                  2.  If you are using the new CCP substitute, ZCPR or
                      equivalents, you  can  only  enter  an 80 column
                      command  line.  You will have to enter the  TERM
                      and   UTIL   libraries   separately   (when   L2
                      complains) and then also re-enter the  DEFF  and
                      DEFF2 library names (in that order).

            4.  This is NOT  (sigh...) a very fancy 'C' mode.  It will
                not take a line like

                if (itistrue()) { do1(); do2();} else { do3(); do4();}

                and  magically transform it  into  "acceptable"  style
                like

                                     if (itistrue()) {
                                             do1();
                                             do2();
                                     }
                                     else {
                                             do3();
                                             do4();
                                     } .

                The necessary magic to do something  like  that  takes
                too  much space (space is limited by the start of  the
                external  variables)  and  might  make MINCE miss some
                characters  (not  too  likely  - the space  limitation
                seems to me to be paramount).  You would also have  to
                look  out  for "do { .. } while ();" syntax since  <my
                feeling is that> the "while ();" should be on the SAME
                line as the '}'; that can get to be tedious. 

            I use 'C' mode  mainly  to  make sure I have matching '{'s
          and '}'s and to let me see  my block delimiters clearly; not
          to do ALL the work for me. 

            These  changes may give rise to some other quirky behavior
          so I'd like feedback on any problems.  I can be  reached  at
          (312-968-6927)  or you can leave a message on the Hyde  Park
          RCP/M System for me. 

                                        Hope you enjoy the changes,
                                        Herb Schulz.
