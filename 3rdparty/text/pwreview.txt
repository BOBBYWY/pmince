   Perfect Writer                                                 Bud Stolker

   Perfect Writer

   A standard cliche for reviewers of word processing software is to claim
   that "Soft-Star Super Perfect Word-Master Letter-Writer' (substitute your
   favorite name) is so easy to learn that "I wrote this review in the first
   hour I used it.' Somehow such claims never ring true. Any word processor
   sophisticated enough to handle the needs of today's users deserves
   careful study.

   Because Computer Services Corp. of Amrrica states in its full-page
   display ads that its Perfect Writer is simple enough for unskilled users,
   I had hoped to learn it quickly. I wanted to exercise my imperative as a
   reviewer to use the software to write this evaluation. After all, I can
   turn a cliche with the best of them. It automatically footnotes; I wanted
   to provide you with some pithy postscripts. It can format verse; I wanted
   to paeon Perfect-Writer poetically.

   Alas, it was not to be. Though Perfect Writer is easy enough to learn,
   mastery requires considerable time and practice. Installing the program
   on your computer can be difficult. For my machine it was impossible.
   While ultimately I found Perfect Writer to be a superb work, the finest
   total microcomputer software package I have yet encountered, I cannot
   recommend it without several strong reservations.

   Advanced Features

   At the outset let me say that I am impressed. This is a significant
   product--a major achievement in microcomputer software. The advanced
   features of Perfect Writer belie its modest price. For $289 you get a
   well integrated series of programs that incorporates an editor, draft
   printer, fancy print formatter, and a set of configuration programs that
   fit the programs to any large-scale CP/M-compatible computer. You get a
   series of lesson files, some for beginners and some for advanced users,
   that set a standard of excellence other software authors would be wist to
   study. A padded silk-screened binder with integral pocket encloses a
   325-page typeset user's manual and a separate, illustrated command
   summary printed on sturdy card stock.

   When the author says the user's guide is free of jargon and arcane
   "computerese,' he's not kidding. His step-by-step explanations, supported
   by dozens of illustrations and diagrams, instruct the user in plain,
   concise English that makes studying this book a pleasure.

   The package includes a document design program that can invoke over 30
   predefined formats (business letter salutations, indented quotations,
   itemized lists, etc.), providing total control over text output, either
   according to your specifications or its own default instructions. Perfect
   Writer can automatically create a table of contents that lists and
   numbers chapters, sections and subsections, headings, paragraphs, and
   appendices. It even includes page numbers in the contents. Further it can
   generate na alphabetized index of words and topics, complete with page
   numbers. It can insert footnotes anywhere in a document that you specify,
   renumbering them automatically as you add new ones. You can refer to
   items mentioned previously in the text, and Perfect Writer will
   automatically calculate the page on which they appear, and insert the
   page reference for you.

   All these features are standard equipment. Optional extras for Perfect
   Writer include a spelling checker, a mailing list system, and a file
   manager that can sort, merge, and extract data in a variety of formats.
   Each of these additional products is $189.

   The company is willing to support its customers and its software, judging
   by my brief conversations with a support specialist, and in any case
   offers a moneyback guarantee if you are not completely satisfied. What
   more could you possibly want?

   Two things that I want come to mind immediately. One is a computer with
   enough memory and disk storage to satisfy the need of Perfect Writer for
   lots of room. The other is a dealer or resident technician to install the
   program on my dream computer. The Perfect Writer advertisement does not
   specify what size machine is required to run this software. Nor was the
   technician I phoned sure, although he seemed otherwise knowledgeable. As
   it turned out, my 48K Vector Graphic computer is too small for Perfect
   Writer, though the technician claimed to have heard "scattered reports'
   of 48K machines running the software. A more realistic minimum is a
   genuine 56K machine (some CP/Ms reclaim several kilobytes for their own
   use; these won't do) and dual disk drives with at least 150K storage
   disk--250K per disk is preferable. That is more muscle than my own
   machine, with a mere 180K of storage on two disk drives, can muster.

   Unaware that Perfect Writer was too big for my machine, I encountered
   considerable frustration trying to get the program to run. I wound up
   using a friend's much larger computer to evaluate Perfect Writer. Yet
   even with Gerry's expertise as a savvy senior software engineer and his
   intimate knowledge of his own system, we had trouble configuring the
   software. More on that later.

   Comfortable to Use

   Within an hour of sitting down at the terminal, I was comfortable with
   most of the cursor controls. Within five hours I had methodically plowed
   through the lesson files and tried every command at least once. By the
   end of a long day I was able to sling text from file to file like a pro.
   Interestingly, I found two days later that I had forgotten most of the
   commands--a classic case of too much too soon.

   Although the documentation referred to an on-screen help file, none ever
   appeared. Nor could I find such a file in the disk directory. This was a
   minor oversight, and presumably by now a "help' command is part of the
   package. That would be a big help to beginners like me, though using
   Perfect Writer should become second nature with practice. The command
   structure is logical and comsistent. The editor offers satisfactory
   prompting for the more complex operations, as long as you know how to
   enter the higher level command modes in the first place.

   Popular word processors like WordStar and Electric Pencil frequently
   favor a compass arrangement for cursor control: the "east' key moves the
   cursor right; the "north' key moves the cursor up, and so forth. Perfect
   Writer, on the other hand, assigns the most commonly used instructions
   mnemonically: control-F for forward one character, control-B for
   backward. The next higher level of commands employs the same mnemonics,
   but uses the escape key for so-called "Meta' commands: Escape-F moves the
   cursor forward one word; escape-B goes back a word. Commands used even
   less frequently require both an escape and a control character.

   In this regard Perfect Writer bears a strong resemblance to EMACS, a
   venerable screen editor developed at MIT in the early 1970's The EMACS
   design philosophy has merit even today, despite the extra keystrokes
   sometimes required. Multiple key commands that broaden the repertoire of
   available functions adapt well to computers with definable keys. With
   Perfect Writer it is easy to configure any key to deliver any command.

   Flexibility and Safety

   The function-and level-oriented mnemonics, whili requiring the user more
   or less to memorize commands, also provide for greater flexibility and
   safety. Because less frequently used (and more potentially damaging)
   commands require a multiple command sequence, you are less likely to blow
   an entire editing session with an injudicious keystroke. Many is the file
   I have lost while using Electric Pencil I by typing a control-O ("exit to
   operating system and destroy buffer') at the wrong time. Quitting Perfect
   Writer requires a control-X, control-C; then a final verification that
   you do, indeed, intend to end the session.

   Other control-X sequences signal other major operations, such as opening
   and closing files, entering and leaving split-screen windows, and moving
   text between files. You can even lock out the edit commands so that you
   can review the text without fear of inadvertently changing it.

   At every critical point, Perfect Writer prompts you for verification. The
   editor reserves two lines at the bottom or the screen for command prompts
   and status information. With such a sophisticated editor, this feature is
   not only desirable but necessary. The ability of Perfect Writer to
   manipulate text files is awesome, and it is possible to blunder on a
   grand scale. The author of the program wisely provides several ways to
   make a graceful recovery from gross errors, allowing you to recall text
   that you have deleted, to cancel the last command entered, or if all else
   fails, to abandon your temporary text buffers and try again with the
   original files.

   When it comes to managing files, Perfect Writer takes an unconventional
   yet elegant approach. A "virtual memory' scheme enables you to work on
   files larger than the memory capacity of your machine. It simply swaps
   data between disk and memory when it thinks you are not looking. If you
   haven't typed anything for several seconds, the editor briefly flashes a
   "swapping' message and activates the disk drive. While this sounds like a
   perfect way to lose characters by typing while the disk drive is running,
   I found that the swap process works very well indeed. Unless you start to
   type in the split second that the drive first activates, Perfect Writer
   can handle your keystrokes and interleave its own disk file maintenance.
   Try as I might, I was unable to drop more than a character or two, and
   even that required fast reflexes. I was working with a fast 8' disk
   system, however. Swapping could be an annoyance on slower 5-1/4' drives.
   The delay time between last keystroke and start of disk file maintenance
   is easily adjustable to suit your preference.

   You can access up to seven lengthy text files at a time, and display
   portions of any two of them in split screen windows whose sizes you can
   adjust as you move text around. The split screen enables you to move a
   sentence, or several chapters for that matter, from one file to another.
   Simply mark the beginning and end of the text, "delete' it into a buffer
   file, point to the spot in the other file at which you want to insert ti,
   and "yank' it back from the buffer. With paragraphs it is even easier,
   since Perfect Writer recognizes paragraphs as basic units of text. Place
   the cursor anywhere in the paragraph, and Perfect Writer automatically
   figures out how much text should be moved.

   A typical command sequence for moving a paragraph to a different file
   (escape-H, control-W, control-X, O, control-Y) is straightforward, though
   it sounds complicated. True, you'd better pay full attention to opening
   both files, setting up the split screen text window, and marking the
   appropriate text in both files. But consider the alternatives. You could
   merge the two files (assuming you had enough working space), delete the
   excess data, edit and then save an updated file. Or you could extract the
   information, kill the excess, merge it with the new file, edit and save
   the new file, and delete what was left from memory. Then you might want
   to load in the old file, erase the text that you have lifted, and resave
   that file.

   You get the picture. Perfect Writer can save a great deal of work.

   It operates with ease in situations that show up the shortcomings of less
   powerful software. With a high-capacity disk system, say half a megabyte
   or more, each of the seven open text files can be larger than 64K, the
   practical limit of random access memory in 8-bit machines. And you don't
   need to know or care how the computer manages all that information.
   Advanced filehandling routines do the work without a crash, without a
   complaint, without even a dropped character.

   Installation A Problem

   So why am I so hesitant to recommend Perfect Writer? For one thing, it
   can be difficult or impossible to imstall without considerable effort and
   research. For another, its rich command vocabulary makes it more
   complicated for the casual user than a less flexible word processor. And
   it works efficiently only on the largest CP/M systems.

   Installing the screen editor and file handler can be quite simple if you
   are using a standard terminal. The chatty and helpful configuration
   program explains the process, offers a comprehensive list of terminals
   that it "knows,' tests the cursor control features you select, and then
   sets up a file that takes into account your preference in screen
   formatting and disk file management.

   Gerry and I found a bug in the Heathkit terminal installation. The Heath
   option that we selected tested out correctly, but when we tried to run
   the program, the main menu appeared on the screen and immediately erased
   itself. Because the installation program allows you to edit any command
   for any terminal, we had no trouble changing "clear screen' to "clear to
   end of screen.' That solved the problem. A user who is not technically
   oriented might have had trouble, though, since the installation program
   does not test for this particular feature. It tests for everything else,
   and therefore can lull you into a false sense of security.

   And that's one trouble with Perfect Writer. It is advertised as easy to
   use. The ads say "you're off and running in no time.' Not so. You had
   better know your system--and CP/M--thoroughly before trying to install
   these programs. Printer configuration is the really hard part. We tried
   to set up Perfect Writer to use Gerry's Spinwriter, one of the standard
   machines supported by the Perfect Printer module. The first time we tried
   to bring up the printer, Gerry's Votrax speech synthesizer spoke up
   instead. Several hours later, after poring through the manual and trying
   repeatedly to make the Spinwriter print, we gave up for the night.

   The following evening we set up the Spinwriter as a "vanilla' printer:
   one with no underlining, boldfacing, proportional spacing or other fancy
   features. That made it easy to patch in. The printer worked impressively,
   even though we were using slow, inefficient, and unsophisticated CP/M
   printer output routine (the "list device'). The Perfect Writer print
   module gave us several unexpected features in this mode. It was smart
   enough to back over text and retype characters when necessary for
   boldface, underlining, and italics. It reserved whole extra lines into
   which to drop superscripts and subscripts. The ability of this clever
   software to maximize the capabilities of a dumb machine is a real bonus
   for people with inexpensive printers.

   Not For The Faint of Heart

   Heartened, we again tried to select the special Spinwriter driver routine
   for high speed output with all the extra Spinwriter features. Again we
   failed. Gerry found the problem. The Perfect Writer people neglected to
   take into account one of the most sophisticated features of the printer:
   a special printer status line can be hardwired to the computer to make
   the Spinwriter perform at maximum efficiency. Perfect Writer doesn't
   support this.

   We could have fixed the problem by tearing apart the printer and flipping
   switches on a hidden circuit board. Then the printer would have been able
   to use a software status routine. We couldn't make this change because we
   didn't have the extra-cost Spinwriter service manual with all the
   necessary information. In any case, such a job is not for the faint of
   heart.

   This difficult installation process is the weakest link of Perfect
   Writer. While the publishers have addembled a superb total package, they
   have made a critical marketing error in ignoring of understanding the
   complexity of the installation process.

   Computer Services Corporation has targeted its ads to the new cadre of
   noncomputer people who can effectively use Perfect Writer: small business
   owners, managers, authors, grantsmen, pool typists. The manual is written
   for naive users who need know nothing about CP/M or their computer. The
   price is attractive, but for $289 retail price, what dealer in his right
   mind is going to spend several hours installing a custom version of
   Perfect Writer? And what alternative does that leave the unskilled end
   user except to go find a capable software engineer like Gerry, or return
   the package for a frfund?

   I strongly recommend that Perfect Writer be installed by a dealer. Only
   the most dedicated computer users or those with common system
   configurations should attempt to patch in Perfect Writer without
   professional support.

   I further believe that Perfect Writer is for use only by folks with the
   most brawny CP/M systems. At least 56K, high-density disk storage, and an
   80-character video display are all musts. I got far enough into the
   installation process on my own machine to see how Perfect Writer performs
   on an older 16-line by 64-column screen: not well. The last few items in
   the main menu appear only temporarily before being erased by the initial
   command prompt.

   A 40-character Apple screen would not support this menu at all. Anything
   less than a full 24-line display would suffer, too, because of the need
   to display two (and sometimes three) status lines on screen in addition
   to your main text and perhaps a second text window as well.

   To be sure, the blame for our installation woes cannot fall squarely on
   the shoulders of the Perfect Writer people. They have carried the
   configuration programs to a level of extreme simplicity. Still, it is not
   enough. Certainly the software author can not be held accountable for the
   fact that every CP/M system is a little different. And it is certainly
   not his problem that my Vector with its memory-limiting ROMs doesn't have
   the guts for such powerful programs, though he certainly could have told
   me what hardware his program requires.

   Complicated But Bug-Free

   Despite these problems, I think the program itself is terrific. It is the
   best of its type, bar none. And lo and behold, the editor itself seems
   completely bug-free. It is not for everyone. The command structure
   requires some study and requires more keystrokes than other text editors.
   Whether or not you need such a complex system is a personal decision.

   It is a little too complicated for writing grocery lists.

   I can wholeheartedly recommend Perfect Writer for people who want its
   power and flexibility, and who have adequate machines on which to run it.
   Today that means CP/M-compatible systems. But the real strength of the
   program lies in its transportability to larger 16-bit computers, such as
   the IBM PC, that can tap its full potential. A Unix-type version is
   inevitable, I suppose, and that should be a piece of software to be
   spoken of in reverential tones.

   When today's hardware catches up with the kind of software foreshadowed
   by Perfect Writer, perhaps microcomputers will have truly arrived as
   powerful silent partners that quietly do our bidding, enhancing our
   efforts and amplifying our achievements. Certainly Perfect Writer points
   the way.
