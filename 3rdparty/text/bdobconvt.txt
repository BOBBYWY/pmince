Perfect Writer

   Many many years ago, I was involved with the Perfect Writer
   software product from Perfect Software. This was a word processor for CP/M
   and MS-DOS (pre-windows) machines.

   You can download a copy for CP/M here. As further aside, Perfect
   Writer itself would not have been possible without Mince and Scribble
   from Mark of the Unicorn, which was in turn dependent on the excellent
   BDS C compiler from Leor Zolman. Thanks, Leor!

   Sometimes people ask if they can “recover” old Perfect Writer files.

   Perfect Writer files are plain text files (unlike, say, Microsoft Word
   files) – so no special translator program is necessary. The formatting
   commands appear as plain text embedded in the document as well. Here’s
   what I’d recommend as a plan of action:

   1) Find a 5 1/2″ drive to read the floppies (if they are ms-dos floppies).
   You probably already identified this as the first step. Happily, nearly
   any 486/pentium (1,2,3,4) is still compatible with 5 1/2″ drives, if you
   can find one. I’ve got one on one of my PIII machines in the basement. I
   keep moving the same old disk drive over (it started on a 286, i think) to
   new machines when I upgrade. Change the bios setup to tell it you’ve got a
   1.2M 5 1/2″ instead of a 1.44M 3.5″. And write protect them before you
   start – you don’t want to erase one by accident.

   If the floppies are CP/M ones, you may want to try and use xenocopy
   which can read many CP/M floppies on your PC.

   2) then depending on whether your friend included formatting commands in
   his masterpieces or not you have a some choices. Formatting commands in
   Perfect Writer look a
   little bit like HTML (although it pre-dates it by more than a decade).
   They’re always an @ sign followed by a command word, and then the target
   enclosed in delimiters. For example in HTML you would say <i>yikes</i> to
   italicize, in Perfect Writer you would say @i(yikes) or perhaps
   @begin(i)yikes@end(i)

   3) If there’s no formatting included in his masterpieces, then you’re
   nearly done. Copy the files off the old floppies onto new 3.5″ ones, and
   rename them all to .TXT files. you can open them in any word processor and
   be happy.

   4) If there’s embedded formatting then you can rename them to .txt and
   leave the formatting in, and let your associate open them in a word
   processor and then fix up the formatting himself.

   5) If you want to preserve the formatting my recommendation is to convert
   it to HTML. You can either do this manually in a text editor (even Notepad
   is sufficient), or with an automated program. You’ll have to write the
   program yourself. I did this myself once many years ago for some old
   documents of my own. What I did was to write some editor macros for emacs
   to do the conversion. I didn’t even save the macros at the time, which
   shows how little value I placed on them. Today, I’d probably do it the
   same way if I had to again – or perhaps write a simple program in Perl or
   awk to do it.

   In Conclusion, you’ve got a pretty easy task ahead of you, provided the
   floppies themselves are still readable (sometimes a challenge with old
   floppies).

   Good Luck!
