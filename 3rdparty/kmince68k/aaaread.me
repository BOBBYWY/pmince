    This is the code for `KMince'.  There are several submit (.sub)
files I used to build the system on my machine.  You may need to edit
these files for your system.  My system is setup with three disk
drives:

      A: - the system and boot disk (a floppy)
      B: - the user disk (another floppy)
and   E: - a RAMDISK for fast scratch space.  (I use the E: drive to
hold commonly used programs and files, like the C compiler.)

     I solved the too-long-command-line problem mentioned in the
notes that comes with Mince for CP/M-68K, by putting all but one of
the object files (.o) into a library with the AR68 program.  The
submit file ADDLIB.SUB will put one or more object files into the
library.  You need to be carefull of the order of the files - see
MINCELIB.LST for the correct order.

    The submit file CM.SUB will compile one module.  It is really
just a slight variation of the C.SUB file supplied with CP/M-68K.
The submit file CML.SUB will link up a copy of mince.  It is setup to
generate an non-relocatable .68K file with a start address of $500.

    You may need to change KEYPAD.C to select which type of terminal
you are using.  Also, you will have to modify the swap file (using
CONFIG.68K) to include the escape sequences to turn on and off the
alternitive keypad modes for your terminal.  For most VT52 clone
terminals the sequences are ESC-= to turn on the keypad and ESC-> to
turn it off.  The turn on sequence should be part of the terminal
initialize sequence and the turn off sequence should be part of the
terminal reset sequence.  If your terminal is not covered by one the
terminals already set up, you should be able to modify one the
existing files to suit.  The files H19KEYS.C, VI50KEYS.C, VT100KEY.C,
VT52KEYS.C and Z29KEYS.C do not get compiled by themselves.  One of
them gets included into KEYPAD.C when it gets compiled.

    Presently five main kinds of terminals are supported:

      H19KEYS.C  - H/Z-19's
      VI50KEYS.C - Visual 50's
      VT100KEY.C - VT100's and look alikes (VT101, VT102, VT125, GiGi's)
      VT52KEYS.C - VT52 clones, mainly InfoTon types
      Z29KEYS.C  - H/Z-29's (a different flaver of VT52).

Most popular smart terminals are either VT100 (ANSI) or VT52 clones.
So, between the VT52KEYS.C and VT100KEY.C files you should not have
alot of trouble building a KMince system.

      The KMINCE.DOC file is a brief manual describing the KMince
keypad and other features KMince provides.  All of Mince's normal
commands and key bindings are still there.  Kmince just adds some
extra goodies.
