We did have a version of EMACS which was not MINCE, but which was of
uncertain distribution rights. This version got lost in an accidental
disk deletion a few months back, and was not backed up to tape. In
the mean time Mince/Scribble was obtained from Unicorn, and we have
been using that editor on both our 68000's and VAX since then.

The Mince/Scribble combination is a very servicable combination,
it has been used on the morrow microprocessor systems to produce
most of the documentation LMI has produced in-house. 

Its probably up to Mache to talk to Unicorn about prices, and to find
out about the alternatives such as Perfect Writer, Final Word,
Emacs from UniPress, Emacs from Computer Corporation of America.
I've heard good things about the Emacs from CCA. Cost on a VAX
was $300 per cpu at one time.

On the other hand, there is an emacs which can be obtained from someone
RMS introduced me to at MegaTest. This I am pursuing too.
However, I do not feel that I have enough price/promise information
at my disposal to decide what is the best thing for LMI to do.
