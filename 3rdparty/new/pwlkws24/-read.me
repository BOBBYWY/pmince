-read.me documentation for  == Perf*Star ==   November 17, 1989:

Perfect Writer allows radical alterations to it's command set. As an editor
more powerful than Wordstar, it seemed worthwhile to me some three years ago
to 'hack' that command set into a rough semblance of the Wordstar command set.
In this, I was partially successful, especially in causing PW to mimic the
basic editing commands of Wordstar, and building additional commands around
the "Wordstar diamond" concept.

I recently went back and updated the command set to more closely mimic
Wordstar in some respects.
