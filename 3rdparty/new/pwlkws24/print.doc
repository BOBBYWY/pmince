			   Printing with Perf*Star

Three methods are open to the user of Perf*Star:

1. Use Perfect Formatter and Perfect Printer. Very, very powerful options are
open to the user of these sophisticated print programs....

2. However, if you'd rather skip the sometimes painful contortions one must
pass through in order to get things properly printed using the above, simply
use Wordstar's printer options. Since WS4 even allows you to type 'WS
mytext.bla p' -- Sending 'mytext' directly to the printer without any
inbetween step -- this is a quite nice option.

3. Use a simple public domain print program like 'Print III' from the ZCPR3
folks.....

I use 2 most, then 3, and (when I want footnotes or fancy printouts) 1. Try
them all.... and consult your Perfect Writer manual on installation procedures
for your printer and PF.DAT, the file overlay for Perfect Formatter. Like I
said, powerful stuff. 

Sometime when I have time, I'll throw in my ZCPR3 VMENU writer's overlay --
homemade, just like mom's. If anyone's interested, let me know at the below
address. If not, I'll save my time and yours.
