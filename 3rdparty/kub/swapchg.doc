	  PERFECT WRITER SWAP FILE CHANGE PROGRAM, SWAPCHG

This wonderful program by Chip Weems allows you to easily create
Perfect Writer PW.SWP files of any usable size.  The standard size
is 64k, but larger sizes are necessary if you want to edit a file
larger than about 55k and you do not wish to break it into smaller
files.

For the Kaypro II (disk space 191k), some maximum usable sizes are
the following:
-------------------------------------------------------------------
CONTENTS OF EDIT DISK (BESIDES PW.SWP):	       FIN	PW.SWP
PW.COM  PF.*   PP.COM  PW.HLP  MENU.COM	      FILES    MAX SIZE

  x	  x	  x	  x	   x		yes	  64k
  x	  x	  x	  x			yes	  80k
  x	  x	  x				yes	  88k
  x			  x			no	 144k
  x						no	 152k

		       - - - NOTES - - -

1. The swap file size must be a multiple of 8, as shown (actual
space occupied is 1k greater).

2. PF.* means PF.COM and PF.DAT.

3. FIN files are not required for editing or "quick printing."  They
ARE required for "formatted printing" (underlining, boldface, sub-
and superscripts, and other advanced formatting features).

4. If PF.* and PP.COM are omitted, formatting and printing your
files must be done with a another disk containing these files.

5. To use Perfect Writer without the MENU: After the prompt B> type
A:PW followed by the name of your file.  (Assumes Edit disk in A,
your writings disk in B, with B the "logged" disk.)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

USE: Type SWAPCHG, hit RETURN and follow directions.  SWAPCHG
displays its progress while running and signals completion with
"Done."

Note that PW.SWP files for version 1.20 of Perfect Writer are not
compatible with PW.SWP files from earlier versions.  When using
SWAPCHG you must use a PW.SWP which is correct for your version of
Perfect Writer.  Otherwise you will get later a PW error message
about "bad version."  

Chip Weems wrote the original SBASIC source for this program,
sometimes called PWSWPCHG (KUG Bulletin Board, 5/21/83).  I made
it twice as fast and easier to use and named it SWAPCHG.

Chip Weems also wrote a longer, more general "Homegrown PWCONFIG"
(KUGRAM Aug/Sept 1983, p. 16).  In addition to doing what SWAPCHG
does, it can set the default values of the cursor start line, fill
column, tab spacing, indent column, CPU clock rate, and delay count. 
He sent me an extended "novice-proof" version in August 1983.  I
have added a "$LINES" command to double its speed and made it
available under the name PWCONFG3.  Chip's KUGRAM discussion is in
PWCONFG3.DOC.
