			  READ-SWP.DOC

This program retrieves your text from a Swap file and writes it
on a new file called SWAP.MSS, which can then be read and edited
by Perfect Writer.

You NEED this utility right after you try to write to a disk and
get a bad disk message.  Perhaps the disk was full, or had a
"Write Protect" tape on it, or you neglected to Warm Boot after
changing disks.  Whatever the reason, put this disk in drive B:,
put your PW Edit disk in drive A: and press RESET.  At the A>
prompt, type B:<CR>.  At the B> prompt, type READ-SWP <CR>.  The
program will write a new file, SWAP.MSS, on this disk, so make
sure that YOU HAVE EMPTY SPACE ON THE DISK to receive it (at
least 64K). 

Paging through a PW.SWP file is a little like sorting garbage. 
Your file is in there someplace, usually right at the front.  But
so is a lot of other junk.  This program copies about 10 pages at
a time, then gives you an opportunity to get out of the routine,
if you want to.  You see on the screen the data that's going into
SWAP.MSS.  

When you've got your file back, use PW EDIT, with its 2-window
feature, to edit the file, yanking out only what you want to keep.

PIP the edited data file over to a data disk, verify that you've
got what you want, then ERA B:SWAP.MSS to make room to correct
your next mistake.
