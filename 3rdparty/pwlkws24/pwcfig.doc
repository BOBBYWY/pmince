	    PWCFIG -- The Configuration Program for Perfect Writer

Perfect Writer for Kaypros did NOT come with a configuration program, since of
course (???!!!?) PW was already configured for the Kaypro. Numerous public
domain versions have come and gone, but this one is the smallest (and most
simple to use) of those I've seen. I prefer it to the commercial version, of
which I have a copy.

Keeping things short, here's how it works:

Type 'pwcfig' at the prompt, and a menu appears like this [default values
listed to the right are mine]....


		      Configuration Parameters

		1. Preferred cursor row:	10
		2. Default fill column:		78
		3. Default tab column width:	 8
		4. Default indent column:	 0
		5. CPU clock speed (MHz):	 4
		6. Keyboard idle delay: 	300
		7. Swap File Length (1K pages): 200
		8. Default Mode:		Fill
		9. Update swap file on disk
		10. Exit swap file update

1. Scrolling up or down, where would you like the cursor to end up after
screen refesh has finished? (Default is 10 -- I leave it that way.)

2. The right margin number where text will automatically wrap around to a new
line.... default is 65. I go for 78 myself.

3. How big do you want your tabs to be when you hit the tab key? 8 is the
default.

4. Default left margin.... zero, of course.

5. This has to do with how quick your machine is. Old Kaypros are 2.5, '84s
are 4, and special speed-up chips from Advent and Micro-C offer anywhere from
5 to 8 MHz. 4 is the default, and you can get away with that even on the old
Kaypros.

6. How long PW waits between keystrokes before 'swapping' goes on in PW.SWP
overlay. Leave it 300.

7. Want to make your swap file big enough for some really hefty manuscripts?
You can go to 200+ Kilobytes, which I have done. Default is a paltry 64K.

8. Write Mode that PW defaults to on startup. It's Fill, and I leave it that
way. Normal's nice if you're a programmer or making up some complex charts.

9. Updates PW.SWP with your changes when you're done tinkering with 1-8.

10. Exit to CPM.....

Most important functions (to me, at least): 

Being able to alter the size of the swap file is important for those people
who do work on very large files (or many medium sized files simultaneously).
If for nothing else, this program is invaluable for that. I also like having
things out to the right edge of my screen, thus the 78 value for the fill
column [a la 'right margin'].

- Program 'PWCFIG' unknown author (to me, that is -- I found this on an old
disk via a second hand Kaypro, and went as far as to open up the program code
with Patch18a to search for the author's name. No John Hancock listed in
program code, even. Date program was created was there: 6/5/83.)
