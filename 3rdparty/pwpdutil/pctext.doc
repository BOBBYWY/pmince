DESCRIPTION:  A multi-column text utility for Perfect Writer.

INTRODUCTION
	Perfect Writer lacks capabilites of writing and moving text in
parallel columns.  PCtext overcomes this deficiency by rewriting user
prepared column text for Perfect Calc, loading text in designated parallel
columns. 

	The only code used in this program is the Perfect Calc "GOTO" code:
a right arrow bracket followed by a column designation, as illustrated by
the following tutorial.

TUTORIAL

>a
Head each column block
with the column
desgination, and type
your text the desired
width.  If righthand
justification is not
needed, the simplest
procedure is to set the
"fill" column as the
right margin.  For
example, this column was
>b
set to fill to column
24. This is achieved by
typing: <ESC>24 CTL-X F. 
This short line length
was chosen to illustrate
the text in three
columns.
>c
   Every time you want
to change column
designations, simply
type a line with the
GOTO code.   All columns
will start on the same
line until a new ">a" is
entered.  ">a" starts a
new column bock on the
line following the
longest column of the
preceding block.
>a
>b
   If you want to leave
the "a" column blank,
you must enter ">a"
anyway, just to reset
the block starting line. 
However, if you want to
skip any other column,
it is not nencessary to
type the "GOTO" code for
that column.
>a

If you want a line or a paragraph to extend past the column boundries, 
Perfect Calc will display it only if there is nothing in the adjacent
column(s) to obstruct it.

>a
  After preparing the
column format with
"GOTO" codes, write the
text to disk, exit the
word proecessor, and
load PCtext.  The
program will ask you the
names of the file to
read, and the file to
write. 
>c
(Here we skipped ">b".)
PCtext will boot out
when done.  Then load
Perfect Calc with the
new file written by
PCtext.  When PC is done
reading the file, you
will need to set column
widths to your liking
(CTL-X,w).
>a
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
>a
Once the text is in the
spreadsheet, you can
copy and move it all you
want until you get the
layout that suits you.
>b
You can then save the PC
file as you have revised
it, or send it to the
printer, or save it on
disk as dispayed (CTL-X
CTL-P).
>c
  Let's take a look at
what we've done so far.
