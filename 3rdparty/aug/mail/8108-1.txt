I have allocated an area in the MC:CPM; directory for Public Domain
ONLY code which anyone may wish to contribute.  When uploading or
FTPing a file (from a non-ITS site), simply specify AR9;CPM;fn1 fn2,
where fn1 and fn2 may each be up to six characters.  Then send a
msg to this list telling us what the name of the file is and its
function.

Do NOT include whole pieces of code already available on the
Amethyst distribution disks.  Rather send directions for updating
or modifying the code, OR original code.  In other words, don't
leave entire files around that are already available on the disks.

To: INFO-APPLE at MIT-AI, AMETHYST-USERS at MIT-AI, INFO-CPM at MIT-AI,
    INFO-MICRO at MIT-AI

Dear Apple users, Amethyst users, and CPM people,
   I am a new owner of an Apple II plus, and would appreciate help and
advice from more experienced users. My questions break down into 2 
groups: (1) questions concerning the system I hope to build
around my Apple, and (2) general questions about things I don't 
understand yet. 

My sincere apologies for both the length of this inquiry, and the
redundancy to many of you who are on more than one of the mailing lists.
My thanks for your patience and your help.

BACKGROUND:
	Things I would like to do with my Apple:
		Text editing (writing papers, reports, and student evaluations)
		Programming (my previous experience is with LISP and LOGO)
		Teach my wife programming in LOGO
		Games and Puzzles (Sargon chess, backgammon, various "arcade games")
		Graphics hacking / art work
		Terminal dial up to larger systems (Cyber and Vax in Amherst
			area, and MIT-AI if I can obtain an inexpensive connection
			from Northampton-- this latter would be especially 
			helpful to me)
		LISP programming and perhaps even some of my thesis research (AI)
	    (i am unsure as to the feasibility of some of these things and would
		appreciate your disabusing me of any unrealistic fantasies)

	My current system consists of:
		48k Apple II plus
		Apple disk drive (5.25 in.) with DOS 3.3
		Epson MX-80 printer
		Home color TV (19" with SupRMod modulator)

FANTASY SYSTEM:
    The following is the tentative plan I have for expanding my system.
It is driven largely by my desire to run the AMETHYST software (MINCE 
and SCRIBBLE).
	SOFTCARD Z80 with CPM (so as to be able to run MINCE, etc.)
	80 column, upper/lower case display
	2nd disk drive (5.25 in.)
	16k RAMCARD (to extend to 64k)
	modem
	(color monitor?)
	
QUESTIONS ON SYSTEM EXPANSION:

0. Is my "fantasy system" feasible? That is, WILL IT WORK??
   I am especially anxious to learn of any interaction effects
   or incompatibilities of pieces of the system I am considering.
   Are there components or angles I've overlooked? 

1. Will there be enough slots to put it all together (i count 6)? 
   Will some of them be wanting to go in the same slot?
   Will the Apple heat up and/or explode with all those boards plugged in??
   If so, is it a solution to remove the power supply to outside the Apple
   casing? Would a good fan be adequate to do the job?

2. Is it worth the bother (and expense). I think I can scrounge up
   the money, but will I be reasonably satisfied with the final result
   or will I have only an expensive kludge?

3. Has anyone already tried a similar system? I would be EXTREMELY
   INTERESTED in corresponding with you to learn how it worked out!!

4. Are people happy with the Amethyst package? What are peoples' experiences
   with MINCE and SCRIBBLE on the Apple? How does SCRIBBLE fare when
   combined with the Epson MX-80?

5. Are there radical alternatives I should consider before committing
   myself further to this project? (eg. selling the Apple and building
   or acquiring an alternative system?) How serious a constraint is the
   8 bit processor and 64k address space?? 

6. Any specific recommendations or warnings regarding alternative hardware
   (such as 80 column boards, 16k ram cards, and modems)? In particular
   I am curious as to which (if any) of the 80 column boards would impose the
   least drain on the power supply? 

7. Will a home tv provide adequate resolution for 80 column upper/lower
   case display? How much additional resolution would I get from a color
   monitor (for both text and graphics)?

8. Do ALL the 80 column boards automatically provide upper/lower case display?
   (I'm currently inclined toward the Videx Videoterm)

9. Is the Videx Keyboard Enhancer redundant with the Videoterm board?
   (if not, is it a reasonable way to upgrade the keyboard?)
   What is the best way for me to obtain keyboard entry of upper/lower case
   and other ascii characters (preferably using the shift key)??

10. What should I look for in a modem? Is the Hayes Micromodem II everything
   its cracked up to be? Are there reasonable 1200 baud modems for the
   Apple?

11. Will Apple Pascal software run on the alternative 16k ram boards (Andromeda,
	Microsoft RAMCARD, etc.)? Would I really want Apple Pascal anyway?

12. Does anyone have experience with any of the "friction feed" add-ons for
   the MX-80 (such as Orange Micro's, or the one advertised for $15)? 
   What about the dot graphics updrade (do I correctly recall they claimed
   this will also provide italic fonts?)?

13. How can I get the best prices on equipment I purchase? Are mail order
   houses generally reliable, or are some of them fly-by-nighters that may
   take my money and run? Are there ways I can get wholesale prices on
   single quantity (I expect I'm dreaming, but it can't hurt to ask).

14. Is service a big issue with micro-computer ownership? (I've only had my
   system for 3 weeks now). Should I be wary of Mail Order houses on this
   account?

GENERAL INFORMATIONAL QUESTIONS:

1. Could some kind and patient soul please explain to me what is involved
   in Up and Down Loading? I understand (i think) that they have to do
   with shipping files (or is it just programs? -- please clarify) back
   and forth between micros and mainframes. Are the problems primarily due
   to differences in word size? or are there other more subtle issues that
   I can't imagine?

2. Has anyone developed a central catalog of software purchased or written
   by various people who would be willing to share their resources?

3. Any suggestions as to my best means for hooking into MIT-AI from the
   Northampton/Amherst area? Can I do network hopping through any commercial
   networks at reasonable prices? Are long distance phone lines reliable
   for transmitting information, or are they too noisy? Any and all suggestions
   will be gratefully accepted (and shared with our own Dave McDonald (DDM) who
   is also located in Amherst).

4. Can one get away with "turning over" diskettes and using the other side?
   One can cut out a second "write enable" hole, and store things on both
   sides of a diskette. Is there any danger of information bleed-through
   from using both sides simultaneously for storage?? Does the risk become
   greater as the disk surfaces wear away??

Thank you again for your patience and help. My apologies for this inordinately
long message. I'm very anxious to get on as quickly as possible to expanding
my system, but I'd like to benefit from all your prior experiences.
Apologies also for the redundancy entailed in my sending this to the several
"micro" mailing lists.

The bug I reported was squashed when MOU released their revised
MINCE accompanying their SCRIBBLE 1.3 -- change sheet dated 8/24/81.

The version number of MINCE remained 2.6, however.

For those who care, Keith Peterson's CRCK program indicates
that these .CRL files were new: ATERM, CTERM, and LATERM.

Subject:  a bug?

Message-Id: <25Aug81 224949 WS70@CMU-10A>


I have found that when I recompile and relink MINCE or LMINCE, even
without changing anything, I encounter the following problem:

	MINCE filename seems to occasionally crash the system upon
		execution;

	C-X C-R filename seems to work if MINCE is entered without
		a filename as an argument, but the system crashes as
		soon as a TAB character needs to be displayed.

As a test, I recompiled and relinked both MINCE and LMINCE using the
unchanged sources and .CRL files, and using MC.SUB/LMC.SUB.  Then
I entered the editor, and tried to load BINDINGS.C.  It appeared to
load, but when I tried to move to the next page, the system crashed.
I reset the system and tried again, using COMM1.C, and the system
crashed after the first words of the first line.  This occurred a
bunch of times, with different compilations.

The only thing that seems significant is that the crash always 
occurred when a TAB should have been displayed on the console.

Has anyone else had this problem  Comments  Suggestions  I'll
contact MOU next . . .
