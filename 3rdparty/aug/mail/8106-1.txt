At the very least, you have to:

 -- move the screen marks (in the "scrnmarks") array so that the i-th
mark still corresponds to the i-th screen row.

 -- increment or decrement a variable, which I think is called "tlrow",
that tells which screen row is in the current-row buffer.

 -- move the "sstart" mark, that tells where in the buffer the screen
begins, up or down a line as appropriate.

 -- Set the modified flags on the lines that are being left blank, so
they will be displayed at the next opportunity.

There may be more, but this is all I can think of offhand.  Good luck!

Has anyone looked into what would be involved in doing the following:

I would like to have KbWait perform the following function in addition to
writing out modified pages:  If the cursor is too close too either the top
or bottom of the screen, send a "insert line" or "delete line" to the
terminal (a H19 in this case) as appropriate to keep the cursor in the
"center area" (say lines 5-15) of the screen.

My question is:  Does anyone know exactly what modifications I have to make
to the screen status variables when I do this in order to have refresh
correctly maintain the screen (and write the one line that remains to be
written)?

Yes, bruce roberts at BBN has written display matching paren on ).  He
may also have indent for lisp and forward s-expr.

I dunno if the display matching paren is as slick as the one done at
SRI for Gosling's Emacs.

Has anyone written commands to fine matching open and closed
parens, brackets and braces?  (e.g. Meta-( & co. in EMACS).  If
not I'll sit down this weekend and give them a try, then supply
the code.  Looks pretty easy, which in itself tells me that there
is bound to be some trick required.

Subject: Query about MINCE,AMETHYST, etc....

To the caretaker of the Unicorn Guild,
        Hello, I have been told that this account could be
used to direct queries on the Unicorn line of editors, and
formatters. ( Brian Hess at MIT told me.. )
After hearing rave reviews of your software, I am seriously
considering the purchase of the Amethyst package, but I want
to know if it is compatible with my system.

The ads claim that you must have a cursor addressable terminal,
but the review in Doctor Dobbs said that it may be customized
for memory mapped systems. I have an Exidy Sorcerer, with
its brain damaged 64 by 30 memory mapped screen without
cursor addressing, but with screen clear, and cursor movement.
( up, down, left, right only. )
Could MINCE run on that ? ( also, the keyboard polling
is rather slow... )
Also, is SCRIBBLE an 'nroff' style formatter with codes
like .ce for centering ? ( I hope so... )

Lastly, what really lured me was the inclusion of the
BDS C compiler ( RAH! ) with the purchase of Amethyst..
Do I get the real stuff, with the stdio library package and
the privilege to join the Users' Group ??

Well, sorry to bother you right before summer, but I would like
some info , and if an 'on-line' brochure is available,I would
love it. If not, you could send stuff to
