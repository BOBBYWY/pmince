I am about to acquire an IBM personal computer to do text editing at
home (I'm tired of 1200 baud display refresh).  The ideal mode of
working will be to prepare text with an emacs-like (Mince?)
 editor on my home computer with scribe formatting commands.  When i
want to see the final result on a laser printer, I will upload the file
to the DEC-20 and run it through scribe.  It would be nice of course to
be able to print drafts locally using a mini-scribe that ran on my
PC (Scribble?).

I have several questions.

Does Mince/Scribble run on the IBM PC?

Is Scribble enough like Unilogic Scribe that I can upload a file
to the 20 and run it through Scribe without significant changes?

What is the best file transfer program for uploading/downloading to a
DEC 20?

Does anyone have any experience with this type of operation?

Any help in answering these questions would be appreciated.
