Now that most of you have managed to bring up 2.6 and 1.3, I thought
you'd might like to know what to look forward to in 4.0 (3.x is the
equivalent of 2.x for the 16-bitters) and 1.4, according to Mark:
--------------------

The big new feature will be "state save" and built-in crash recovery.
"State save" is their name for what happens automatically on ITS (for
example): exiting to CP/M, then returning to Mince, you will find the
state of Mince essentially unchanged: all your buffers will still
exist, and contain the same text (whether modified or not), etc.  A
couple of random things, like the previous search string, may get lost
in the process, but "nothing important".  Also, if your hardware or
Mince should crash while you're editing, you can run the "recover"
program, which grovels over your old swap file and salvages what it
can (probably everything except the most recently typed text).

State save is quite definite, but there are some other ideas they are
tossing around.  One is overlays -- are they worth the trouble?
Another is an interpreted command language, to make Mince
interactively extensible.  [Any other ideas?  Comments to the list,
please. -fjw]

No projected release date yet -- probably 5-6 months at least.

Also in the works is Scribble 1.4, which will have greatly improved
widow/orphan behavior, more flexible commands, and overlays for
running in less memory.
