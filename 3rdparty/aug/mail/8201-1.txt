Yes, we're planning to support the IBM P.C.  Currently, we're waiting
for a C compiler to be written for us.  Expecting to be able to ship a
Mince and Scribble on June 1.  (Currently we have a hack Mince written
in BASIC(!) for the P.C. while we download things onto it.)

Yes, Scribble is enough like Scribe (tm DEC or Unilogic Ltd.) to be able
to go from the P.C. to the 20, but not vice-versa -- Scribble does not
support the various technical publication formats and such (i.e. no @make
command) and lacks some other features of Scribe.  And of course Scribe
is general enough that any environments which Scribble may have in the
future which are not in base-level Scribe can be easily fashioned with
an @make or other short-term hacking on the 20, and then used
thereafter.
