You are correct: there are no Insert File nor Write Region commands.
But they're not hard to write, if you're willing to accept the kluge of
secretly reading into and writing from the kill buffer (the kill buffer
is available to code as a real buffer; you just can't get it onto the
screen).

So if you want them, write them!

Did I miss something, or is there not an equivalent to M-X Insert
File and M-X Write Region commands?  (Yes, I know you can read a file
into another buffer and kill and yank it into where you want it, and
vice-versa, but that's kludgey.)

As for being able to use my Edit Key, I stand corrected.  By defining
the console input to be direct port I/O, you are allowed 8-bit
input...
