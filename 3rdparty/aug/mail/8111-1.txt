	Thanks to Barry most of the files from the first
AUG disk are available on my remote CP/M. By "most" I mean
the ones that are not standard RCP/M or CPMUG software. The
files are stored in a passworded USER area. The password is
available to AUG members from Barry (BADOB@MIT-AI). As of
now the files will be available Monday nights unless a
special request is made. Mark of the Unicorn may also be
leaving notes, fixes, etc. there. You are also free to
leave useful material. The number of the remote CP/M is:
(617) 862-0781.

	The ad in October byte for SuperSoft's Star-Edit is how mince
ads should have appeared. (scribble ads too.) The current ad may be flashy,
but doesn't say anything about Mince or Scribble themselves.

-toodles!
