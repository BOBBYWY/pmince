DEFIN.DOC

This is the description of the DEFIN.COM program which was
written by Steve Willett.

This is a filter program which takes an input file and copies
it to an output file with the following modifications:

   1.  All seventh bits are first set low.

   2.  After that all characters which are neither printable
       nor a carriage return or a line feed are replaced
       with a "~" (tilde).

This file treats the input file as an untyped (non text) file
and therefore ignores the ^Z (end of file) marker in CPM text
files.  Therefore it will automatically undo the FIN stop which
is in a Perfect Writer FIN file.  In addition it will probably
stick some garbage at the end of the file which was beyond the
^Z in the last record it reads.

To use it just type DEFIN.  The program prompts you for an input
file name and an output file name.  It will display on the screen
the contents of the output file as it writes it.  After DEFIN is
done, you can use Perfect Writer to edit your new output file.

The new output file will probably have lots fo tildes in it!  They
represent all the control characters and other special characters
which were inserted in the file by Perfect Formatter.  In addition
there will be odd characters imbedded in the tildes - most printers
use printable characters with non-printable characters for their
commands.

You can now use Perfect Writer's Search and Replace functions to
clean up your file.  Try going through it and replacing all "~~"'s
with "~".  This will shorten all those long strings of tildes.  You
will have to recreate all the style and environment commands you had
in the original document, however, since these were converted by
Perfect Formatter into printer commands.

Good luck!
